# Project - All the new ML modes (Tree, Forests, Adaboost and SVM) with Rattle over the Wine_data set

Pleaes upload the win dataset onto your Rattle() console and try out the various Machine learning techniques as discussed in the class.
Start with the decision tress, move on to the Forest and then try out the other techniques with Adaboost and Support Vector Machines.
